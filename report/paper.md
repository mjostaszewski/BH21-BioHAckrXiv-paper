# Abstract

We will integrate resources enabling the visual exploration of the mechanisms of diseases across different levels - gene/protein annotation, 
protein-protein interaction, pathways and genomic variation. Disease maps (disease-maps.org) provide a standardised, diagrammatic way to encode mechanisms of 
human diseases (https://biohackrxiv.org/gmbjv/), with COVID-19 as a prime example (https://fairdomhub.org/projects/190). 
We aim to integrate these maps with data from the recently developed UniProt Alzheimer’s disease portal and COVID-19 platform (https://diseases.uniprot.org, https://covid-19.uniprot.org).

We will work with UniProt and the MINERVA Platform (minerva-web.lcsb.uni.lu), ELIXIR resources which we have already started 
to bring together (https://github.com/xwatkins/disease-map-portal). In this project, we will use the 
Nightingale library (https://ebi-webcomponents.github.io/nightingale/#/), a suite of standardised modular data visualisation components, 
including the protein feature annotation viewer ProtVista, a protein interaction visualisation and a 3D viewer Mol* (https://molstar.org). 
We will embed diagrams visualised by MINERVA with corresponding protein-level visualisations, and explore the sequence annotation visualisation 
to MINERVA via its plugin architecture. Finally, this will allow us to define standards for the data exchange for Nightingale components, 
to make them easily usable by other ELIXIR resources.
